# Way



## Overview

Way is a lightweight, Go-based web framework that integrates with the [Gorilla Mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) router and provides simplified mechanisms for handling HTTP requests inspired by the [echo framework](https://echo.labstack.com)while adding database operations.

## Features

- Custom context for HTTP handlers
- Simplified route declaration (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- Integrated SQL database operations
- Graceful shutdown and startup management

### Note

Currently there is no stable version of Way during it's inital development.
Do not use this project in it's current state, please wait until a version number higher than 0.0.0 is committed
